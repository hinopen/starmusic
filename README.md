Star Music (星の音楽)

Summery : This app is a new music instrument for space lovers. Stars are shown on display, and when you touch the star, you would hear star sings. Stars would make a harmony as your finger moves. 
Sound loudness, pitch and tone color are defined based on properties of each star, e.g. spectral type, parallax, magnitude. These data are obtained from Hipparcos Catalog of NASA database. 

Submit Challenge : We love data.
